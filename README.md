# Usage

If you only want to install the extension, please [visit the website](http://romac.me/mdash/) for more informations.

# Wanna help ?

**Warning:** The code is quite awful at the moment. A big refactoring is on its way, hopefully.

1. Clone the repository.  
   `$ git clone https://romac@github.com/romac/mdash.git`
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`  
3. Toggle the **Developer mode**.  
4. Click **Load unpacked extension...**  
5. Select the previously cloned repository.
