## Installation

### Latest version (from source)

Clone the repository.  
Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.  
Toggle the `Developer mode`.  
Click `Load unpacked extension...`  
Select the previously cloned repository.  

### Latest 'stable' version (packed)

[Download the latest packed version of the extension](https://github.com/romac/mdash/downloads)  
Uncompress the archive.  
Drag 'n drop the .crx file onto Chrome.x

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, just open a new window to activate it.  
You'll now see an empty dashboard.  

To add sections and bookmarks to the dashboard, open the Bookmarks Manager and browse to `/Other Bookmarks/[Dashboard]/`,
which is a folder the extension automatically created (and will recreate if you delete it).

Folders prefixed with the '+' character will be displayed on the left column, ones prefixed with a '-' will show on the right column.  
Feel free to create as many sections as you need.  
Then, browse to any website you'd like to add to the dashboard and click the star at the right of the address bar and choose one of the previously created folders.
